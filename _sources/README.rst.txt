ReLife
======

ReLife is an open source Python library for asset management based on
reliability theory and lifetime data analysis.

- **Survival analysis**: non-parametric estimator (Kaplan-Meier), parametric
  estimator (Maximum Likelihood) and regression models (Accelerated Failure Time
  and Parametric Proportional Hazards) on left-truncated, right-censored and
  left-censored lifetime data.
- **Reliability theory**: optimal age of replacement for time-based mainteance
  policy for one-cycle or infinite number of cycles, with exponential
  discounting.
- **Renewal theory**: expected number of events, expected total costs or
  expected number of replacements for run-to-failures or age replacement
  policies.

Installation
============

From PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

    pip3 install relife

Getting Started
===============

The following example shows the steps to develop a preventive maintenance policy
by age on circuit breakers:

1. Perform a survival analysis on lifetime data,
2. Compute the optimal age of replacement,
3. Compute the expected total discounting costs and number of expected
   replacements for the next years.

Survival analysis
-----------------

The survival analysis is perfomed by computing the Kaplan-Meier estimator and fitting the
parameters of a Weibull and a Gompertz distribution with the maximum likelihood
estimator.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from relife.datasets import load_circuit_breaker
    from relife import KaplanMeier, Weibull, Gompertz, AgeReplacementPolicy

    time, event, entry = load_circuit_breaker().astuple()
    km = KaplanMeier().fit(time,event,entry)
    weibull = Weibull().fit(time,event,entry)
    gompertz = Gompertz().fit(time,event,entry)

The results of fitting the Weibull and Gompertz distributions are compared by
looking at the attributes :code:`weibull.result.AIC` and
:code:`gompertz.result.AIC`. The Gompertz distribution gives the best fit and
will be chosen for the next step of the study. The code below plots the survival
function obtained by the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the maximum likelihood
estimator for the Weibull and Gompertz distributions.

.. code-block:: python

    km.plot()
    weibull.plot()
    gompertz.plot()
    plt.xlabel('Age [year]')
    plt.ylabel('Survival probability')

Optimal age of replacement
--------------------------

We consider 3 circuit breakers with the following parameters:

- the current ages of the circuit breakers are a0 = [15, 20, 25] years,
- the preventive costs of replacement are evaluated cp = 10 k€,
- the failure costs (e.g. lost energy) are evaluated cf = [900, 500, 100] k€,
- the discount rate is rate = 0.04.

.. code-block:: python

    a0 = np.array([15, 20, 25]).reshape(-1,1)
    cp = 10
    cf = np.array([900, 500, 100]).reshape(-1,1)
    policy = AgeReplacementPolicy(gompertz, a0=a0, cf=cf, cp=cp, rate=0.04)
    policy.fit()
    policy.ar1, policy.ar

Where `ar1` are the time left until the first replacement, whereas `ar` is the
optimal age of replacement for the next replacements:

.. code-block:: console

    (array([[10.06828465],
            [11.5204334 ],
            [22.58652687]]),
     array([[20.91858994],
            [25.54939328],
            [41.60855399]]))

The optimal age of replacement minimizes the asymptotic expected equivalent annual
cost. It represents the best compromise between replacement costs and the cost
of the consequences of failure. 

.. code-block:: python

    a = np.arange(1,100,0.1)
    za = policy.asymptotic_expected_equivalent_annual_cost(a)
    za_opt = policy.asymptotic_expected_equivalent_annual_cost()
    plt.plot(a, za.T)
    for i, ar in enumerate(policy.ar):
        plt.scatter(ar, za_opt[i], c=f'C{i}',
            label=f" cf={cf[i,0]} k€, ar={ar[0]:0.1f} years")
    plt.xlabel('Age of preventive replacement [years]')
    plt.ylabel('Asymptotic expected equivalent annual cost [k€]')
    plt.legend()

.. figure:: _images/optimal-ages.png

Budget and operations planning
------------------------------

For budgeting, the expected total discounted costs for the 3 circuit breakers
are computed and we can plot the total annual discounted costs for the next 30
years, including costs of failures and costs of preventive replacements.

.. code-block:: python

    dt = 0.5
    step = int(1/dt)
    t = np.arange(0, 30+dt, dt)
    z = policy.expected_total_cost(t).sum(axis=0)
    y = t[::step][1:]
    q = np.diff(z[::step])
    plt.bar(2020+y, q, align='edge', width=-0.8, alpha=0.8, color='C2')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Expected discounted annual cost in k€')

.. figure:: _images/annual-costs.png

Then the total number of replacements are projected for the next 30 years.
Failure replacements are counted separately in order to prevent and prepare the
workload of the maintenance teams.

.. code-block::

    mt = policy.expected_total_cost(t, cf=1, cp=1, rate=0).sum(axis=0)
    mf = policy.expected_total_cost(t, cf=1, cp=0, rate=0).sum(axis=0)
    qt = np.diff(mt[::step])
    qf = np.diff(mf[::step])
    plt.bar(y+2020, qt, align='edge', width=-0.8, alpha=0.8,
        color='C1', label='all replacements')
    plt.bar(y+2020, qf, align='edge', width=-0.8, alpha=0.8,
        color='C0', label='failure replacements only')
    plt.xlabel('Years')
    plt.ylabel('Expected number of annual replacements')
    plt.legend()

The figure shows the expected replacements for the very small sample of 3
circuit breakers. When the population of assets is large, the expected failure
replacements is a useful information to build up a stock of materials.
